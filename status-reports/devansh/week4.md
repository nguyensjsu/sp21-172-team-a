### Accomplishments
For the Week#4 I created a branch devansh/login and devansh/newLogin. I worked with Alisha on the first branch and the spring security material. This week was a little harsh in respect to school and I was unable to get as much work as I would have wished to gotten done. I ran into some complications with spring security and this is still in progress. I am hoping to get done in the next day or two and integrate the functionality into the main branch.
