### Accomplishments
For the Week#3 I created a branch devansh/week3 which dealt with working with integrating all the changes. I continued to work on porting over the HTML/CSS files to thymeleaf format and establishing a connection between them and making sure that they work. I also creating the respective controllers that were needed. After I was done with the devansh/week3 branch, I created a pull request and merged the changes to main. I created another branch to work on further functionality for this week as well as the next on the branch devansh/login. I will be working on user authentication using spring-secuirity on this branch.

### Challenges
I am finally getting better at understanding the requirement and implementing functionality. The only challenge will be to successfully authenticate users with spring secuirity.
