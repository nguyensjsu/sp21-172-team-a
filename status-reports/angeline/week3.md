### Accomplishments
Our team had a bit of miscommunication and confusion over how the cashier's application should tie in with other applications, so changes had to be made several times to reflect what teammates needed.

1) Bring in OrderController.java and make changes in index.html to take in ThymeLeaf radio button input into the Order model (IN PROGRESS) [Commit](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp21-172-team-a/commit/af03fb689e9534cb04dfb9c0ae6ce1077e70c752)

Also included a DrinkModel.java to create the ability to list all of the options at once.

### Challenges
Due to having multiple applications at a time that are not yet running on GCP, our group struggled with work overlap and issues managing two separate applications at once. Due to the large overlap, merges always brought in big changes that caused several merge conflicts to parse through.

Side Note: This past week overlapped with other projects and I was unable to complete as much as previously - prioritizing this project for the upcoming week.
