### Accomplishments
This week was the first time our team really got together to do a deep dive on what this project is about. As a result, Team A was really setting up the foundations for the greater ends of our project. 

**Cards:**

1) Set up Spring MVC structure for frontend [Commit](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp21-172-team-a/commit/b01b908f95eeee0d3fd03cabc352e97384dc0062)

While others worked on creating the static HTML/CSS pages, I created spring-cashier (taking inspiration from previous labs) to port the work into a Spring project for our work to be run on localhost. This sets the scene for follow-up [issue](Finish setting up controllers to move static HTML/CSS files to Spring).

2) Replace Starbucks Go API with Spring API ([Pull Request](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp21-172-team-a/pull/1))

This was a simple task of removing the Starbucks API written in Go and replace it with Spring Starbucks API from Lab #6. 

### Challenges
Being our first week, our team spent a bit of time having misunderstandings on exactly what the scope of our project was. Our initial challenge was struggling to understand what had to be done and our immediate next steps. While not as much concrete work could be completed this week, I was able to use some of my Agile experience to break down our work and goals for the upcoming week. 

As you can see in our [project task board](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp21-172-team-a/projects/1), I worked with the team to create 6 issues and assigned that rather evenly split up work to hopefully complete the majority of our Spring dependent features in Week 2.
